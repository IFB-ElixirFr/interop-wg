You will discover the new sequence file formats, learn about the usual biases of this data type and run different kind of analysis such as spliced alignment on a reference genome, novel gene and transcript discovery, expression quantification of the genes and transcripts. Organized jointly by the MIAT unit and bioinfo genotoul platforms.</p>\r\n"
