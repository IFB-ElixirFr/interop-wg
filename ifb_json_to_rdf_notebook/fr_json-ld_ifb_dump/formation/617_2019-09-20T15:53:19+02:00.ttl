You will discover sequence file formats, learn about expression profiles of miRNA and other small non coding RNA and run different kind of analysis such as reads cleaning, alignment on a reference genome, detection and annotation of new and known miRNA, and expression quantification. Organized jointly by the Sigenae and bioinfo genotoul platforms.</p>\r\n"
