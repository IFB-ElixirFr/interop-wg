        "@value": "<p>Microarray probe design application. It enables the design of specific probes of each gene in an entire genome, with an original approach. The use of specific microarray technology requires a very detailed attention for the design of specific probes spotted on the solid phase. These problems are far from being commonplace since they refer to complex physicochemical constraints. We propose a new approach to design oligonucleotides which combines good specificity with a potentially high sensitivity. This approach is original in the biological point of view as far as in the algorithmic point of view, and is particularly adapted when dealing with a complex target mixture (where itâ€™s difficult to find specific sequences fo all genes).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Publication :<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rimour, S., D.
