        "@value": "<p>crisscross is Somatic structural variants (SV) tool that uses WGS data and two complementary signals from the read alignments to detect structural variants: (a) discordant pair mapping (wrong read orientation or incorrect insert-size) and (b) soft-clipping (unmapped first or last bases of read) that allows resolving SV breakpoints at the base pair. A cluster of discordant pairs and one or two clusters of soft-clipped reads defined an SV candidate: the discordant pairs cluster defined two associated regions, possibly on different chromosomes and the soft-clipped reads cluster(s), located in these regions, pinpointed the potential SV breakpoint positions. We further checked that the soft-clipped bases at each SV breakpoint were correctly aligned in the neighborhood of the associated region. SV events were then classified as germline or somatic depending on their presence in the matched normal sample.</p>\r\n"
