        "@value": "<p>SynTView is a comparative and interactive viewer for microbial genomes, designed to run as either a web-based tool (Flash technology) or a desktop application (AIR environment). The basis of the program is a generic genome browser with sub-maps holding information about genomic objects (annotations). The software is characterised by the presentation of syntenic organisations of microbial genomes and the visualisation of polymorphism data (typically Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms â€” SNPs) along these genomes; these features are accessible to the user in an integrated way. A variety of specialised views are available and are all dynamically inter-connected (including linear and circular multi-genome representations, dot plots, phylogenetic profiles, SNP density maps, and more).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Documentation, tutorials and demonstration sites are available at the URL:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://genopole.pasteur.fr/SynTView\">http://genopole.pasteur.fr/SynTView</a></p>\r\n"
