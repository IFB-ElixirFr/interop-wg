        "@value": "<p><a href=\"http://bioinfo.lifl.fr/RNA/carnac/\">Carnac</a> is a software tool for analysing the hypothetical secondary structure of a family of homologous RNA. It aims at predicting if the sequences actually share a common secondary structure. When this structure exists, Carnac is then able to correctly recover a large amount of the folded stems. The input is a set of single-stranded RNA sequences that need not to be aligned. The folding strategy relies on a thermodynamic model with energy minimization. It combines information coming from locally conserved elements of the primary structure and mutual information between sequences with covariations too.</p>\r\n"
