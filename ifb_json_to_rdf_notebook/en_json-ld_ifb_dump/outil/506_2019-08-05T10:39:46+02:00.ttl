S-MART also provides many ways to visualize your data: size of the reads, density on the genome, distance with respect to a reference set, and the correlation of two data sets (with cloud plots).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zytnicki M, Quesneville H (2011) S-MART, A Software Toolbox to Aid RNA-seq Data Analysis.
