Description	"Metric to test if the metadata resource has a unique identifier.  This is done by comparing the GUID to the patterns (by regexp) of known GUID schemas such as URLs and DOIs.

Known schema are registered in FAIRSharing (https://fairsharing.org/standards/?q=&selected_facets=type_exact:identifier%20schema). For URLs that don't follow a schema in FAIRSharing we test known URL persistence schemas (purl, oclc, fdlp, purlz, w3id, ark).
