Description	Metric to test if the metadata resource has a unique identifier.  This is done by comparing the GUID to the patterns (by regexp) of known GUID schemas such as URLs and DOIs.  Known schema are registered in FAIRSharing (https://fairsharing.org/standards/?q=&selected_facets=type_exact:identifier%20schema)	Metric to test if the unique identifier of the metadata resource is likely to be persistent. Known schema are registered in FAIRSharing (https://fairsharing.org/standards/?q=&selected_facets=type_exact:identifier%20schema). For URLs that don't follow a schema in FAIRSharing we test known URL persistence schemas (purl, oclc, fdlp, purlz, w3id, ark).  	Metric to test if the unique identifier of the data resource is likely to be persistent. Known schema are registered in FAIRSharing (https://fairsharing.org/standards/?q=&selected_facets=type_exact:identifier%20schema). For URLs that don't follow a schema in FAIRSharing we test known URL persistence schemas (purl, oclc, fdlp, purlz, w3id, ark).  	Tests whether a machine is able to find structured metadata.  This could be (for example) RDFa, embedded json, json-ld, or content-negotiated structured metadata such as RDF Turtle	Tests whether a machine is able to find 'grounded' metadata.  i.e. metadata terms that are in a resolvable namespace, where resolution leads to a definition of the meaning of the term. Examples include JSON-LD, embedded schema, or any form of RDF. This test currently excludes XML, even when terms are namespaced.  Future versions of this test may be more flexible.	Metric to test if the metadata contains the unique identifier to the data. This is done by searching for a variety of properties, including foaf:primaryTopic, schema:mainEntity, schema:distribution, sio:is-about, and iao:is-about. schema codeRepository is used for software releases.	Metric to test if the metadata contains the unique identifier to the metadata itself.  This is done using a variety of 'scraping' tools, including DOI metadata resolution, the use of the 'extruct' Python tool, and others...
