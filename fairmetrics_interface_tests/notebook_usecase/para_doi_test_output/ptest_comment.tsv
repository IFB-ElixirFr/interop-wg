Description	"Tests whether a machine is able to find structured metadata.  This could be (for example) RDFa, embedded json, json-ld, or content-negotiated structured metadata such as RDF Turtle"	"Tests whether a machine is able to find 'grounded' metadata.  i.e. metadata terms that are in a resolvable namespace, where resolution leads to a definition of the meaning of the term. Examples include JSON-LD, embedded schema, or any form of RDF. This test currently excludes XML, even when terms are namespaced.  Future versions of this test may be more flexible."
