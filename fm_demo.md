# Monitoring progress in FAIRification through self-assessment of resources maturity indicators

## Context

The 2019 FAIR Evaluator framework (Wilkinson, Dumontier et al., Scientific Data 6:174 is composed of Maturity Indicators (MI), compliance tests and the evaluator application itself. The authors expect growing contributions in MI specification and compliance tests to improve relevance and coverage of FAIR evaluation. They also propose that these tests should be carried out by third party organisations. However, small efforts have been done so far from a user perspective, to take advantage from MI compliance tests in the process of improving FAIRness of oneâ€™s own resources.

## Approach 

For now, we are willing to use the FAIRMetrics smartapi to create a simple interface and provide the user with an easy way to verify how FAIR is his ressource.
We want to provide the user with clear informations on how to validate each aspect of the FAIR principles and help him to improve the FAIRness of his ressource.

## Demonstration

The aim of this demonstration is to provide a typical usecase for this project idea.

### Step 1 - Ressource generation

A researcher created a fresh new dataset and host it on the web, associated to a URL or DOI.

### Step 2 - How FAIR is the ressource

The researcher want to have an idea of how FAIR is his ressource, to maybe improve it further.

### Step 3 - Submit the ressource to an easy to use web application

The researcher submit his ressource throught a URL or DOI with minimal informations required (no personnal informations).

### Step 4 - Testing the ressource against the Maturity Indicators

Provide the researcher with a one page result, with negative or positive score for each Maturity Indicator.

### Step 5 - Self-assesment of the FAIRness

When the result is negative, explain where it failed, and provide suggestions of how to validate this Maturity Indicator.
This will provide a usefull help to the researcher, and then allow him to improve the FAIRness of his ressource.

### Step 6 - Improve and repeat

The reasercher will try to improve the FAIRness of his ressource, and test it again, and again, trying to validate the MI(s) he is interested in.
