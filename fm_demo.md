## Approach 

## Demonstration

The aim of this demonstration is to provide a typical usecase for this project idea.

### Step 1 - Ressource generation

A researcher created a fresh new dataset and host it on the web, associated to a URL or DOI.

### Step 2 - How FAIR is the ressource

The researcher want to have an idea of how FAIR is his ressource, to maybe improve it further.

### Step 3 - Submit the ressource to an easy to use web application

The researcher submit his ressource throught a URL or DOI with minimal informations required (no personnal informations).

### Step 4 - Testing the ressource against the Maturity Indicators

Provide the researcher with a one page result, with negative or positive score for each Maturity Indicator.

### Step 5 - Self-assesment of the FAIRness

When the result is negative, explain where it failed, and provide suggestions of how to validate this Maturity Indicator.
This will provide a usefull help to the researcher, and then allow him to improve the FAIRness of his ressource.

### Step 6 - Improve and repeat

The reasercher will try to improve the FAIRness of his ressource, and test it again, and again, trying to validate the MI(s) he is interested in.
